# V2X-InD-conflict-analysis

### Scenario
* A Vehicle is making a maneuver at the intersection, he's unaware of the existence of the Pedestrian, due to an occlusion by the construction zone
* Goal is to make the Vehicle be aware of the existence of potential conflict ahead of time to react properly.
* The Solution is Remote Vehicle/Infrastructure assisted cooperative perception based on sharing intent messages.
